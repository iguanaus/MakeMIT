{"team":45,"title":"Heartbeat","description":"Each heart beats on its own course, but theoretically, while engaged in social situations, heart beats between people can synchronize, creating intangible social connections. Exploiting an awareness of social connections is the touchstone for our work. using infrared technology and GPS, pulses are measured and mapped out on a screen. As people move and interact with others, the collation of heartbeats can be seen. Infrared rays bounce back from iron in the blood, and recorded on a time stamp. That information is sent via WIFI to a server that runs a software to project a map of the geo-locations and beats of each person wearing a bracelet."},
{"team":46,"title":"Simple Facial Recognition","description":"Cafeterias, movie theaters, schools, and many others employ people to literally sit around and determine who was in a certain place at a certain time. Paying someone to do this doesn't make sense when simple facial recognition could do the job. By making facial recognition as simple as plugging in a low-cost box and visiting a webapp, we aim to make this capability open to more than just academics."},

{"team":88,"title":"1GHz Hi-Z Active Differential Oscilloscope Probe","description":"Our hack is a 1GHz differential oscilloscope probe built on a budget of under $50, while comparable commercial probes cost over $1000. Our probe also features an unusually high +/-20V input dynamic range and only 0.5pF of input capacitance, which is superior to many commercially available devices. Because we didn't have a network analyzer, we constructed a TDR system to measure the step response and characterize its performance and test our SPICE model."}]
