[{"team":38,"title":"LEXO","description":"Lexo is a portable glove built to assist in the learning of ASL by guiding the hand into the appropriate symbols. The glove was originally developed to help the deaf blind, but also have applications in assisting , while maintaining user independence.","details":"The glove uses 5 positional servos to reel in fishing line, which is guided by 3d-printed guides placed along the finger. When reeled, the fingers are brought inward, and when released, the elastic naturally brings the finger back to an open position."},
{"team":88,"title":"1GHz Active Differential Oscilloscope Probe","description":"We built a really, really fast voltage probe for an oscilloscope. Normally, this sort of thing would cost on the order of $1000 or more, we built something a hobbyist could put together and use for about $50.","details":"Our probe consists of a pair of high input impedance (0.5pF||30Meg) MOSFET source follower buffers driving a 2GHz opamp configured as a differential amplifier. Power is provided through USB, and a combination of switching and linear regulators derive +5V, +3.3V, and -3.3V supply rails. We started by making a SPICE model and designing, etching, and testing a prototype PCB last week. Then over the course of the week, we redesigned the board for manufacture, sent it out, and populated and tested it today. We would have liked to design a 4-layer board to make routing impedance controlled traces easier, but this was unfeasible in the timeframe, so we settled with a 2-layer PCB. We also designed and assembled a 3D printed case for the probe with an LED at the tip to help illuminate the probing point."},
{"team":435,"title":"Droideka","description":"The Droideka, of the ","details":"Mechanical: In order to move forward, the Droideka swings a pendulum forward, which shifts the center of mass forward as well. The wheel then simply follows the center of mass. To turn, it shifts the battery compartments from side to side, causing the droid to tilt sideways and circle in that direction.    Software/Electrical: Our logic pipeline involves collecting accelerometer data and user commands through an Android app, then sending these commands to the Arduino onboard the droid in order to make it move. The user can control the Droideka's motion by tilting the smartphone. The Arduino then actuates a DC motor (for forward motion) and several servos (for turning and leg motion).    https://github.com/redfern314/droideka  https://github.com/redfern314/droideka-android"},
{"team":35,"title":"GoPro DataPac","description":"We built data sensing package for GoPro that records and displays data (such as speed, acceleration, rotation, location, etc.) with video. We maintained the standard GoPro BacPac form factor to insure compatibility with existing GoPro products. In future iterations we hope to improve the compatibility with GoPro's open source firmware.","details":"Using an Arduino Nano we were able to collect inputs from an IMU, GPS, and barometer. This micro-electronic package was placed inside a 3D printed BacPac case. We also made a custom waterproof housing that protects BacPac accessories during use. Processing was used to aggregate and visualize the data generated by the sensors."},

There are a total of four individual boxes with puzzles that must be solved in succession in order to solve the overarching meta-puzzle."},

We use a Python library adaptation of Arduino control to control them."},
{"team":20,"title":"Vinhiry- A fully integrated at-home internet medication dispenser","description":"Vinhiry is a fully automated medication dispenser with internet capability that addresses at-home elderly patient adherence to prescribed drug treatment. The patient adherence problem is a significant issue that must be addressed, particularly with the world's aging population. Medical non-adherence in the United States, for example, costs an estimated $100 billion each year, accounting for around 10% of hospital admissions and 23% of admissions to nursing homes.           Vinhiry’s solution to improving patient adherence to drug treatments is to integrate a patient’s support network by better connecting a patient with caretakers, family members and medical staff. Features include a personalized online dashboard for caretakers to monitor course of treatment and patient adherence, an emergency response system that will contact the appropriate response team in case patient suffers an accident, and a personalized, robotic automation to deliver medicine to the patient conveniently, at the right dosage, and at the right time.   Currently, the burden of the blame for the patient adherence problem falls on the patients themselves rather than on the system that should be responsible for a patient’s care. Vinhiry will shift the responsibility for patient adherence rightfully towards the patient’s caretakers by improving the connection between patient and caretaker. Not only can we make an impact by improving patient adherence, but we will also make a social impact by placing beneficial tools in the hands of those administering patient care.

{"team":41,"title":"Wakey Wakey","description":"A roommate friendly alarm clock that will gently vibrate when your alarm goes off.  The mattress topper will sense the weight of a person in bed so that it will go off again if you get back into bed.","details":"There is a 7 segment display, wired to a button, that displays the time. There is a timer that will count down depending on how many button presses the user has made, acting as a pseudo alarm clock. After the count down, the pressure sensors will then detect any forces that were applied.    The pressure sensor sends a range from 0V to 5V depending on the force applied to it. When it reaches over 3V, the vibrational motors will then vibrate. The vibrational motors are wired up in 3 parallel circuits, located throughout the area of the mattress. They will continue to vibrate until the pressure sensor sends a voltage that is below 3V. "}]
